## Critical: One Instance Per Project

**CommandCenter MUST be deployed separately for each project.**

### Why?

CommandCenter stores:
- GitHub access tokens (encrypted)
- Proprietary research documents
- RAG knowledge embeddings
- Repository commit history
- Technology assessments

**Sharing an instance = Data breach risk**

### Correct Setup

```
‚úÖ CORRECT - Isolated instances:

~/projects/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performia/commandcenter/          # Performia data only
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client-x/commandcenter/           # Client X data only  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ internal-research/commandcenter/  # Internal data only
```

```
‚ùå WRONG - Shared instance:

~/commandcenter/  # Tracking ALL projects = security violation
```

### Quick Isolation Checklist

For each new project:

1. Clone CommandCenter to project directory
2. Set unique `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` in `.env`
3. Generate unique `SECRET_KEY`
4. Use project-specific API keys
5. Configure unique ports (if running multiple)
