# Week 2 Security Tests Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Implement CommandCenter security tests for project isolation, JWT validation, and basic RBAC (18 tests total).

**Architecture:** Test-driven security validation using pytest fixtures for user isolation, JWT token factories for authentication testing, and FastAPI TestClient for API endpoint testing. All tests use mocked dependencies (no real GitHub API or external services).

**Tech Stack:** pytest, pytest-asyncio, FastAPI TestClient, PyJWT, bcrypt

**Worktree:** `.worktrees/testing-security` â†’ `testing/week2-security` branch

## Task 1: Security Test Infrastructure

**Files:**
- Create: `backend/tests/security/conftest.py`
- Create: `backend/tests/security/__init__.py`

**Step 1: Create security test directory structure**

```bash
mkdir -p backend/tests/security
touch backend/tests/security/__init__.py
```

**Step 2: Write security fixtures**

Create `backend/tests/security/conftest.py`:

```python
"""Security test fixtures."""
import pytest
from datetime import timedelta
from app.utils.auth import create_access_token
from tests.utils.factories import UserFactory, ProjectFactory


@pytest.fixture
async def user_a(db_session):
    """Create isolated user A with project-a."""
    user = await UserFactory.create(
        db_session,
        email="user_a@test.com",
        project_id="project-a"
    )
    return user


@pytest.fixture
async def user_b(db_session):
    """Create isolated user B with project-b."""
    user = await UserFactory.create(
        db_session,
        email="user_b@test.com",

        tamper_type: str = "signature"
    ):
        if expires_delta is None:
            expires_delta = timedelta(minutes=30)

        token = create_access_token(
            data={"sub": user_id},
            expires_delta=expires_delta
        )

        if tampered:
            parts = token.split(".")
            if tamper_type == "signature":
                # Modify signature (last part)
                parts[2] = parts[2][:-5] + "XXXXX"
            elif tamper_type == "payload":
                # Modify payload (middle part)
                parts[1] = parts[1][:-5] + "XXXXX"
            token = ".".join(parts)

        return token

    return _create_token


@pytest.fixture
def auth_headers_factory(jwt_token_factory):
    """Create authorization headers for user.

    Args:
        user: User object to create token for

    Returns:
        Dictionary with Authorization header
    """
    def _create_headers(user):
        token = jwt_token_factory(user_id=str(user.id))
        return {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}

    return _create_headers
```

**Step 3: Verify fixtures import correctly**

Run:
```bash
cd backend
python -c "from tests.security.conftest import *; print('Fixtures loaded successfully')"
```

Expected: "Fixtures loaded successfully"

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add backend/tests/security/
git commit -m "test: Add security test infrastructure and fixtures

- Create security test directory structure
- Add user_a and user_b fixtures for isolation testing
- Add jwt_token_factory for JWT security tests

    # Create technology as project owner
    tech = await TechnologyFactory.create(
        db_session,
        title="Owner Tech",
        project_id=user_a.project_id
    )
    await db_session.commit()

    headers = auth_headers_factory(user_a)

    # Should be able to read
    response = await client.get(f"/api/v1/technologies/{tech.id}", headers=headers)
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # Should be able to update
    response = await client.put(
        f"/api/v1/technologies/{tech.id}",
        headers=headers,
        json={"title": "Updated Title"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # Should be able to delete
    response = await client.delete(f"/api/v1/technologies/{tech.id}", headers=headers)
    assert response.status_code == 204 or response.status_code == 200
```

**Step 3: Write test for non-owner read-only access (if roles exist)**

Add to `backend/tests/security/test_rbac_basic.py`:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_non_owner_has_read_only_access(
    user_a, client, auth_headers_factory, db_session
):
    """Non-owner has read-only access to shared project resources.

    Note: This test assumes role-based access is implemented.
    If not, this test will be skipped or modified.
    """
    # Create a viewer/member user for same project
    viewer = await UserFactory.create(
        db_session,
        email="viewer@test.com",
        project_id=user_a.project_id,
        role="viewer"  # If roles not implemented, use "member"
    )

    # Create technology as owner
    tech = await TechnologyFactory.create(
        db_session,
        title="Shared Tech",
        project_id=user_a.project_id
    )
    await db_session.commit()

    headers = auth_headers_factory(viewer)

    # Should be able to read
    response = await client.get(f"/api/v1/technologies/{tech.id}", headers=headers)
    assert response.status_code == 200

    # Should NOT be able to update
    response = await client.put(
        f"/api/v1/technologies/{tech.id}",
        headers=headers,
        json={"title": "Hacked"}
    )
    assert response.status_code == 403

    # Should NOT be able to delete
    response = await client.delete(f"/api/v1/technologies/{tech.id}", headers=headers)
    assert response.status_code == 403
```

**Step 4: Run tests to verify behavior**

Run:
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/security/test_rbac_basic.py -v
```

Expected: FAIL if RBAC not implemented, PASS if already in place

**Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add backend/tests/security/test_rbac_basic.py
git commit -m "test: Add basic RBAC tests (3 tests)

- Test regular user cannot delete other users
- Test project owner has full access
- Test non-owner has read-only access (if roles implemented)

Total RBAC tests: 3"
```

## Task 9: Documentation & Summary

**Files:**
- Create: `backend/tests/security/README.md`
- Modify: `docs/TESTING_WEEK2.md` (if doesn't exist, reference design doc)

**Step 1: Write security tests README**

Create `backend/tests/security/README.md`:

```markdown
# Security Tests

## Overview

Security tests validate project isolation, JWT authentication, and basic RBAC authorization.

## Test Structure

### Project Isolation Tests (`test_project_isolation.py`)

**Goal:** Ensure users can only access their own project data.

**Tests (10 total):**
- User cannot read other user's technologies (3 tests: read, modify, delete)
- User cannot read other user's repositories (1 test)
- User cannot read other user's research tasks (1 test)
- User cannot read other user's knowledge entries (1 test)
- List endpoints filtered by project_id (3 tests)
- Cross-project foreign key references rejected (1 test)

**Key Fixtures:**
- `user_a`: User with project-a
- `user_b`: User with project-b
- `auth_headers_factory`: Creates auth headers for user

### JWT Security Tests (`test_jwt_security.py`)

**Goal:** Validate JWT token security and proper error handling.

**Tests (5 total):**
- Tampered signature rejected (1 test)
- Tampered payload rejected (1 test)
- Expired token rejected (1 test)
- Invalid token format rejected (1 test)
- Malformed token returns 401 not 500 (1 test)

**Key Fixtures:**
- `jwt_token_factory`: Creates tokens with optional tampering

### RBAC Basic Tests (`test_rbac_basic.py`)

**Goal:** Validate basic role-based access control.

**Tests (3 total):**
- Regular user cannot delete other users (1 test)
- Project owner has full access (1 test)
- Non-owner has read-only access (1 test)

## Running Security Tests

**All security tests:**
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/security/ -v
```

**Specific test file:**
```bash
pytest tests/security/test_project_isolation.py -v
```

**Specific test:**
```bash
pytest tests/security/test_jwt_security.py::test_expired_token_rejected -v
```

**In Docker:**
```bash
make test-security
```

## Test Count

**Total: 18 tests**
- Project isolation: 10 tests
- JWT security: 5 tests
- RBAC basic: 3 tests

## Notes

- All tests use mocked dependencies (no real external services)
- Tests follow TDD approach (written before implementation)
- Tests are designed to fail initially (red phase)
- Implementation should make tests pass (green phase)
```

**Step 2: Create summary document**

Create `backend/tests/security/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`:

```markdown
# Security Tests Implementation Summary

```

## Next Steps

1. **Implement project isolation in API endpoints:**
   - Add project_id filtering to all list endpoints
   - Add project_id validation to all detail endpoints
   - Add database-level constraints

   - Return 401 for all auth failures

3. **Implement basic RBAC:**
   - Add role field to User model (if not exists)
   - Implement role checking in endpoints
   - Add permission decorators/middleware

4. **Run tests after implementation:**
   ```bash
   pytest tests/security/ -v
   ```
   Expected: All 18 tests PASS

## Verification Checklist

Before marking track complete:

- [ ] All 18 tests implemented and syntactically valid
- [ ] Tests organized in 3 files (isolation, JWT, RBAC)
- [ ] Security fixtures complete (user_a, user_b, jwt_token_factory)
- [ ] README.md created with test overview
- [ ] IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md created with deliverables
- [ ] All tests discoverable via pytest --collect-only
- [ ] No syntax errors in test files
- [ ] Git commits follow conventions
- [ ] Branch ready for merge to main

## Notes for Implementation

**These tests are designed to FAIL initially** (TDD red phase). This is expected and correct.

After tests are written, implementation work is needed:

1. **API Layer:** Add project_id filtering to all endpoints
2. **Service Layer:** Add project_id validation
3. **Database:** Add project_id constraints
4. **Auth:** Ensure strict JWT validation
5. **RBAC:** Implement role-based permissions

Once implementation is complete, re-run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/security/ -v
```

Expected: All 18 tests PASS (TDD green phase)

---

**Plan Status:** Complete
**Next Action:** Use superpowers:executing-plans or superpowers:subagent-driven-development to implement this plan
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours for test implementation
