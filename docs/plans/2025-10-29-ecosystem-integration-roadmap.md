# Veria Ecosystem Intelligence & Automation Roadmap  
_Updated: 2025-10-29_

## 1. Vision Snapshot
- **Unify** CommandCenter instances (Veria, MRKTZR, ROLLIZR, Performia, Fractlzr pilots) under a proactive intelligence layer that continuously scouts technologies, business signals, and operational risks.
- **Streamline** developer and agent workflows by centralising model/MCP configuration, IDE context, and knowledge hygiene so Gemini, Codex, Claude, and internal agents collaborate seamlessly.
- **Orchestrate** the ecosystem via Hub: cross-project insights, shared knowledge access (with isolation), and fleet-wide automation (configs, patches, rollouts).
- **Accelerate** go-to-market loops: MRKTZR automated campaigns drive Veria partnerships; ROLLIZR feeds structured consolidation targets; Veria returns compliance signals and trust assets.

## 2. Immediate Foundations (Weeks 0‑2)
1. **Stabilise Dagger Template**
   - Install backend/ frontend dependencies using project requirements (`pip install -r`, `npm install`).
   - Run Alembic migrations + seed scripts automatically on container start.
   - Persist secrets/volumes; generate once and store per project in Hub DB.
   - Implement health probes (backend `/health`, Postgres, Redis) surfaced in Hub.
2. **Runtime Control Pane**
   - CommandCenter UI module to manage model keys, provider routing, MCP servers, agent prompts; sync to project `.env` and VS Code workspaces.
   - Expose context API (recent tasks, knowledge highlights, active models) for IDE agents.
3. **Scheduled Intelligence Jobs**
   - Configure Celery/cron pipeline for tech scouting (GitHub trending, arXiv, release feeds), business news (RSS/paid APIs), dependency risk watch (Security advisories).
   - Store outputs as Knowledge Base entries tagged with `status: new_candidate`, `impact: high` etc., link to Technologies/Repositories.

## 3. Cross-Project Intelligence Loops (Weeks 2‑6)
1. **MRKTZR ↔ CommandCenter Integration**
   - Feed MRKTZR MarketGraph updates into each project’s Knowledge Base.
   - Auto-create research tasks for high-signal leads; tie into CommandCenter dashboards.
   - Allow MRKTZR Campaign Mesh to publish campaign status into project activity feeds.
2. **ROLLIZR Synergy Distribution**
   - Route Opportunity Scanner + Synergy Engine results to Veria, MRKTZR workspaces (e.g., `partnership_candidate`, `acquisition_target` tasks).
   - Provide Consolidation brief templates stored within Knowledge Base.
3. **Hub Portfolio Analytics**
   - Aggregate compliance scores, marketing throughput, opportunity pipeline, knowledge freshness across all instances; visualise in Hub.
   - Highlight dormant projects, at-risk KPIs, and emerging trends.

## 4. Knowledge & Document Hygiene (Weeks 4‑8)
1. **Smart Ingestion Policies**
   - Watch designated folders; auto-index, version, and mark superseded docs.
   - Expiry reminders + review workflow for stale artefacts.
2. **Living Briefs**
   - Auto-generate dynamic summaries per technology/repository with KPIs, research findings, business news, and open tasks.
   - Regenerate on new knowledge or alert triggers; link to dashboards and Hub search.
3. **Collaborative Annotations**
   - Allow agents/humans to tag passages, assign follow-ups, and add commentary that persists back into RAG embeddings.
   - Provide approvals or confirmation steps to keep knowledge trustworthy.

## 5. Veria Partnership Automation (Weeks 4‑10)
1. **Always-On Partnership Pipeline**
   - Combine MRKTZR Partnership Streamliner + ROLLIZR Synergy scoring + external funding/product signals.
   - Maintain pipeline table in Veria CommandCenter with statuses (`hypothesis`, `contacted`, `in review`, `launched`).
2. **Auto-Generated Outreach & Collateral**
   - MRKTZR generates co-sell packages and sends to Veria for approval.
   - Use Veria compliance engine to attach trust evidence; optionally embed Fractlzr seals.
3. **Feedback Loop**
   - Track conversion metrics and update scoring models; feed back into MRKTZR/ROLLIZR heuristics.

## 6. Developer & Agent Workflow Upgrades (Weeks 6‑12)
1. **MCP/Tool Bootstrapper**
   - Declarative MCP config; one-click install/update + health checks.
   - CLI sync to push provider keys, MCP endpoints, and prompt presets to local dev environments.
2. **IDE Experience**
   - Auto-generate `.code-workspace` files with curated tasks, repo groups, scripts.
   - Command palette actions fed from CommandCenter (open research brief, run repo sync, launch orchestrator job).
3. **Context API Enhancements**
   - Provide real-time context snapshots (recent docs, alerts, tasks) for Gemini/Codex/Claude LLM agents.
   - Standardise response schema so agents can share knowledge easily between tooling.

## 7. Hub Evolution (Ongoing)
1. **Unified Signal Console**
   - Consolidated feed for tech discoveries, business news, build incidents, compliance alerts.
   - Severity levels, filters, and deep links to the relevant instance.
2. **Cross-Project Semantic Search**
   - Federated search across Knowledge Bases with project-level isolation; enable re-use of research while respecting boundaries.
3. **Fleet Automation**
   - Push global config updates (model migrations, security patches) from Hub with staged rollout/rollback support.
   - Scheduled audits verifying agent configs, dependency versions, and security controls.

## 8. Ecosystem Interplay Summary
| Project | Benefits Received | Contributions |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Veria** | Automated compliance research, partnership pipeline, MRKTZR campaign feeds, ROLLIZR deal intel | Trust layer, compliance APIs, audit artefacts, regulatory insights |
| **MRKTZR** | CommandCenter scheduling, knowledge hygiene, partner scoring, Veria compliance assets | Campaign Mesh outputs, MarketGraph data, partnership intelligence |
| **ROLLIZR** | Research orchestration, opportunity validation, compliance hooks | Fragmentation scans, synergy scoring, deal blueprints |
| **Performia** | Creative storytelling briefs, knowledge search, marketing collateral alignment | Experience layers for campaigns, educational content |
| **Fractlzr** | Integration sandbox for compliance watermarking/creative assets | Secure visual signatures for outreach & compliance docs |

## 9. Technical Implementation Notes
- **Scheduling**: Use Celery beat / APScheduler within backend; define per-project job configs stored in DB.
- **APIs**: Extend `jobs`, `schedules`, and `knowledge` routers for automated ingestion; add endpoints for IDE context and partner pipeline CRUD.
- **Data isolation**: Ensure new features respect project scoping—propagate `project_id` through services and repositories before enabling cross-search.
- **Observability**: Instrument Prometheus metrics for scouting latency, ingestion counts, partnership funnel, MCP health; publish dashboards via Grafana.
- **Security**: Store provider keys/secrets via Vault or encrypted fields; integrate compliance with Veria’s key management policies.

## 10. Recommended Sequence (Quarterly Milestones)
1. **Q4 2025**  
   - Dagger template v2, control pane, intelligence jobs, MRKTZR ↔ Veria pipeline MVP.
