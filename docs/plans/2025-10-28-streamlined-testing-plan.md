# Streamlined Testing Plan - 3 Week Implementation

**Created:** 2025-10-28
**Approach:** Parallel Quick-start
**Timeline:** 3 weeks (2025-10-28 to 2025-11-18)
**Goal:** Quick coverage baseline with solid foundation

## Context

Building on the comprehensive testing assessment (see `docs/TESTING_STRATEGY_ASSESSMENT.md`), this streamlined plan focuses on getting test coverage up and running quickly while addressing critical gaps identified in the Phase 2 audit.

**Key Decision Factors:**
- Primary Goal: Quick coverage baseline
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks for solid foundation

## Three-Week Overview

| Week | Focus | Tests Added | Key Deliverables |
|------|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **1** | Foundation + Minimal Coverage | 30 | Infrastructure, CI setup, basic coverage per layer |
| **2** | Critical Gaps (Security + Performance) | 49 | Security isolation, N+1 detection, performance benchmarks |
| **3** | Balance + Optimize | 61 | Balanced pyramid, CI optimization, documentation |
| **Total** | | **140 tests** | Production-ready testing system |

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk: Tests become flaky**
- Mitigation: Use proper waits, avoid arbitrary timeouts, retry logic in CI

**Risk: CI becomes too slow**
- Mitigation: Aggressive caching, test sharding, selective test running

**Risk: Team doesn't adopt testing practices**
- Mitigation: Clear documentation, pair programming, test review in PRs

**Risk: Coverage doesn't reflect quality**
- Mitigation: Focus on critical paths, meaningful assertions, not just line coverage

## Next Steps After Week 3

### Immediate (Week 4)
- Monitor test stability for 1 week
- Fix any flaky tests
- Gather team feedback on testing workflow

### Short-term (Weeks 5-8)
- Expand security tests (add SQL injection, XSS, CSRF tests)
- Add load testing framework (K6 or Locust)
- Visual regression testing (Percy or Chromatic)
- Expand frontend coverage to 80%

### Long-term (Months 2-3)
- Contract testing (Pact)
- Mutation testing (Mutmut)
- Performance regression tracking
