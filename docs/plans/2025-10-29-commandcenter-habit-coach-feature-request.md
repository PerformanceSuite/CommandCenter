# Feature Request: CommandCenter Habit Coach & Workflow Intelligence

## 1. Summary
Introduce a continuous “Habit Coach” capability that monitors developer workflows, correlates them with internal best-practice assets (e.g., `docs/Ideas/Best_Practices_Ideas`), and delivers actionable nudges through CommandCenter and the Hub. The feature marries telemetry, knowledge ingestion, and recommendation services so CommandCenter evolves from a passive knowledge base into a proactive partner that suggests better habits, tools, and workflows in real time.

## 2. Motivation
- **Reduce operational drag:** Repeated lint/test misses, flaky test triage, and stale docs slow delivery. Automated feedback surfaces risks sooner.
- **Amplify internal knowledge:** Curated guidance often sits unused. Associating it with observed behavior increases adoption and keeps practices current.
- **Enable personalized coaching:** Teams and individuals have different gaps; tailored nudges drive higher engagement than generic checklists.
- **Support Ecosystem vision:** Aligns with the 2025-10-29 Ecosystem Integration Roadmap goal of a proactive intelligence layer spanning Veria, MRKTZR, ROLLIZR, and satellite projects.

## 3. Objectives
1. Capture user and system habits safely (IDE, CLI, CI, Hub activity) with explicit consent.
2. Continuously ingest internal/external best practices and map them to behavioral signals.
3. Generate actionable recommendations ranked by impact and confidence, citing source material.
4. Deliver insights through the Hub, CommandCenter UI, PR bots, and IDE agents, with options to snooze, accept, or auto-apply fixes.
5. Measure adoption via habit change (e.g., lint pre-commit rate) and surface ROI metrics.

## 4. Feature Scope & Phasing
### Phase 1 – Telemetry & Knowledge Foundations (4–6 weeks)
- Instrument frontend, CLI, git hooks, and CI to emit anonymized events (with opt-in) into a telemetry store.
- Extend existing knowledge ingestion jobs to watch curated docs (`docs/Ideas/**`, retros, incident reports) and external feeds (RSS, release notes) tagged by domain.
- Expose a governance dashboard allowing users to view, export, or delete their captured events.

### Phase 2 – Coaching Engine MVP (6–8 weeks)
- Implement a rule-based insight service (e.g., “PR merged without `make lint` → suggest pre-merge lint checklist”).
- Link each rule to knowledge snippets or external references stored in KnowledgeBeast.
- Deliver notifications via:
  - Hub “Coaching Feed” widget.
  - PR bot comments (GitHub/GitLab).
  - Optional IDE toast via MCP Skill.
- Track resolution outcomes (dismissed, accepted, ignored) for feedback.

### Phase 3 – Adaptive Intelligence & Automation (8–12 weeks)
- Introduce scoring models (e.g., Bayesian habit predictors) prioritising high-risk behaviors.
- Enable automated tasks (run `make lint`, open research task) when users opt in.
- Integrate cross-project insights at Hub level (compare lint adherence across Veria vs. MRKTZR while respecting isolation).
- Provide team-level reporting and recommendations for OKR planning.

## 5. Architecture & Components
- **Telemetry Pipeline:** 
  - Client SDKs (web, CLI, IDE) sending events through authenticated WebSocket/REST endpoints.
  - Ingestion service (FastAPI) writing to TimescaleDB or ClickHouse for scalable analytics.
  - Consent registry per user/project; events tagged with `project_id` for isolation.
- **Knowledge Ingestion Layer:** 
  - Reuse scheduled jobs from the Ecosystem roadmap (Section 2 & 4) to collect external signals.
  - Additional watcher for repository docs with semantic diffing and version history.
  - Embedding storage in KnowledgeBeast with metadata linking to habit categories.
- **Insight Engine:** 
  - Rule DSL stored in Postgres (`rules`, `triggers`, `actions` tables).
  - Model service (optional) using lightweight classifiers for adoption probability.
  - Recommendation graph mapping telemetry → habit → knowledge resource.
- **Delivery Surfaces:** 
  - Hub UI module with triage queue, snooze state, adoption charts.
  - CommandCenter dashboard cards per project (recent alerts, outstanding actions).
  - PR bot integration (existing automation channel).
  - IDE agent (MCP Skill) retrieving recommendations scoped to current file/task.
- **Governance & Privacy:** 
  - Consent toggles per user/project; defaults to off for new users.
  - Event minimization (command hashes vs. raw arguments where possible).
  - Audit log of recommendations issued and user responses.

## 6. Alignment with Ecosystem Integration Roadmap (2025-10-29)
- **Section 2 – Scheduled Intelligence Jobs:** Habit Coach extends the same ingestion stack to developer workflow content.
- **Section 4 – Knowledge Hygiene:** Versioning and expiry workflows ensure recommendations cite current guidance.
- **Section 6 – Developer & Agent Workflow Upgrades:** Telemetry SDK and IDE experience complement MCP Bootstrapper and Context API enhancements.
- **Section 7 – Hub Evolution:** Coaching Feed becomes a specialized view within the Unified Signal Console; insights feed the cross-project analytics layer.
- **Section 9 – Observability:** Existing Prometheus/Grafana plans can track recommendation throughput, response times, and adoption KPIs.

## 7. Risks & Mitigations
- **Privacy concerns:** Address via explicit opt-in, redaction, and transparent data access tools.
- **Alert fatigue:** Start with limited, high-impact rules; throttle duplicates; provide snooze/dismiss options.
- **Knowledge drift:** Schedule periodic review tasks when source docs age past SLA.
- **Model bias or errors:** Keep humans-in-the-loop; log false positives for regular tuning; maintain rule fallbacks.
- **Integration complexity:** Pilot inside a single project (Veria) before cross-project rollout to validate instrumentation.

## 8. Success Metrics
- ≥80 % of active users opt into telemetry after pilot phase with no privacy complaints.
- 30 % reduction in lint/test failures caught in CI (measured over 60 days).
- 50 % of surfaced recommendations marked “helpful” or resolved.
- Increased usage of referenced knowledge docs (views per week) by ≥25 %.
- Time-to-adopt new workflow (e.g., Playwright checklist) reduced by 40 %.

## 9. Dependencies & Resources
- Telemetry SDK development (frontend + CLI + IDE agents).
- Knowledge ingestion enhancements (scheduled jobs, diffing).
- Backend services for rules, recommendation graph, consent registry.
- UI work for Hub/CommandCenter modules.
- DevOps support for storage, monitoring, and security reviews.
- Coordination with Ecosystem squads (Veria platform, MRKTZR campaign, ROLLIZR synergy teams) to share signals without breaking isolation.

## 10. Open Questions
1. What minimum telemetry granularity is acceptable to balance utility with privacy?
2. Should coaching rules live in code or be configurable via Hub UI?
3. How do we prioritize between individual vs. team-level recommendations?
4. Which external sources are highest ROI for continual monitoring (e.g., vendor release feeds vs. academic papers)?
5. Do we extend this to non-engineering workflows (marketing, operations) in the first release?

## 11. Next Actions
1. Review this feature request with platform leadership and the Ecosystem roadmap owners.
2. Identify pilot project (recommended: Veria) and secure stakeholder approval for telemetry opt-in.
3. Draft technical spikes for telemetry SDK, ingestion watchers, and rules service.
4. Align Q4 2025/Q1 2026 roadmap milestones with phased delivery (Phase 1 foundations in Q4).
