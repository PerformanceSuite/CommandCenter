## Current Focus
Production Foundations - Infrastructure Hardening (Planning Phase)

## Status
- **Phase**: Issue #62 - ESLint & Type Safety (Complete!)
- **Branch**: main (pushed to origin)
- **Last Work**: Fixed 28 failing tests via architectural refactoring (2025-10-29)
- **ESLint Status**: 0 errors, 0 warnings ✅
- **Testing**: ✅ **All research tests passing!** (22/22 = 100%)
  - Fixed via hook extraction: useResearchSummary, useResearchTaskList
  - Components refactored to pure rendering
  - Tests mock hooks instead of fake timers
  - Overall: 130/145 tests passing (89.7%)
  - Remaining 15 failures are pre-existing, unrelated to Issue #62
  - Week 1-3: 1,676 total tests (backend + e2e still passing)
- **CI/CD**: ✅ Research component tests green, ready for CI
- **Type Safety**: ✅ All 'any' types replaced with proper types
- **Branch Cleanup**: ✅ Week 3 branches deleted (local + remote)
- **Architecture**: ✅ Improved separation of concerns (hooks pattern)
- **Docker Testing**: Complete infrastructure ✅
- **Hub**: Dagger SDK orchestration + 74 tests ✅
- **RAG Backend**: KnowledgeBeast v3.0 (libs/knowledgebeast/) with PostgresBackend ✅
- **USS Version**: v2.1 with auto-commit + /re-init support
- **Hygiene Score**: ✅ Clean (root directory professional)
- **Achievement**: Week 1: 833% | Week 2: 158% | Week 3: 100%+ across all tracks
- **Latest Session (2025-10-29 15:47)**: Brainstormed production foundations design
  - Analyzed ecosystem integration + habit coach roadmaps (infrastructure overlap identified)
  - Infrastructure assessment: 50% complete (Celery ✅, RAG ✅, Dagger 🟡, Ingestion ❌)
  - Selected approach: Sequential component hardening for production-grade quality
  - Validated 3-phase design: Dagger hardening → Ingestion automation → Observability
- **Next Step**: Document design, set up worktree, create implementation plan, begin Phase A

## Quick Commands
