# CommandCenter: Research Management Workflow & Feature Specification

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Based on:** Performia research documents analysis

---

## Real-World Use Case: Performia R&D Management

### The Problem

You have deep research documents (e.g., "Future Music Tech Research.md", "Immersive Experience Report.md") that identify **dozens of technologies** requiring investigation:

**From Performia docs:**
- 69 technologies mentioned in Technology Matrix
- 10+ strategic technology deep dives required
- Multiple domains: AI models, hardware NPUs, web APIs, frameworks, spatial audio, avatars, networking
- Each technology needs: evaluation, prototyping, integration assessment, competitive analysis
- Research findings scattered across documents, papers, APIs, GitHub repos, Hacker News

### Your Workflow Goals

1. **Extract Research Topics** from strategic documents
2. **Track Technologies** on radar (evaluation → experiment → adopt/monitor)
3. **Launch Multi-Agent Research** tasks with model/agent choice
4. **Review Results** in organized, queryable format
5. **Follow-up Questions** with same agent that did research
6. **Monitor New Developments** (Hacker News, GitHub trending, research papers) for relevant updates
7. **Competitive Intelligence** via Business Radar
8. **Marketing Actionables** for go-to-market strategy

---

## CommandCenter Feature Specification

### **1. Research Hub** (Enhanced)

#### 1.1 Document Intelligence

**Aut

o-Extract Research Topics:**
```
Input: Upload "Future Music Tech Research.md" (28K tokens)
Output:
  - 69 technologies extracted to Tech Radar
  - 10 research tasks created from "Strategic Recommendations"
  - Relationships auto-mapped (HS-TasNet → Real-Time Source Separation research task)
```

**Features:**
- **Smart Document Upload**: Parse markdown/PDF research docs
- **Entity Extraction**: Auto-detect technologies, vendors, papers, GitHub repos
- **Task Generation**: Convert "Recommendations" sections to actionable research tasks
- **Dependency Mapping**: Link related technologies (e.g., ONNX Runtime → Apple M4 Neural Engine)

#### 1.2 Multi-Agent Research Orchestration

**Launch Parallel Research Agents:**
```bash
# Via CLI or UI
commandcenter research deploy \
  --task "Evaluate HS-TasNet for real-time source separation" \
  --agent claude-sonnet-4 \
  --model anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 \
  --duration 4h \
  --deliverables "Technical feasibility report, integration cost estimate, prototype code"

# Launches agent in isolated worktree with:
- Access to KnowledgeBeast (Performia project RAG)
- Access to web search, GitHub, papers
- Structured output format
```

**Agent Types:**
- **Technology Evaluator**: Assess feasibility, performance, integration cost
- **Competitive Analyst**: Track competitors, market trends, pricing
- **Prototype Builder**: Create proof-of-concept code
- **Literature Reviewer**: Survey academic papers, blog posts
- **API Investigator**: Test APIs, document endpoints, measure latency

**Model/Agent Selection:**
- Choose per task: Claude (Sonnet/Opus), GPT-4, Gemini, local models
- Agent profiles: Research-focused, code-focused, analysis-focused

#### 1.3 Research Results Management

**Structured Outputs:**
```
research_tasks/
├── hs-tasnet-evaluation/
│   ├── report.md              # Agent's comprehensive report
│   ├── findings.json          # Structured data (latency, SDR, cost)
│   ├── prototype/             # Code artifacts
│   ├── references.json        # Papers, links, GitHub repos
│   └── conversation.md        # Chat history with agent
```

**Follow-Up Conversations:**
```bash
# Resume chat with same agent
commandcenter research followup hs-tasnet-evaluation \
  --question "What CPU optimization techniques would reduce latency to <15ms?"

# Agent has full context of previous research
```

**Knowledge Base Integration:**
- All research reports auto-indexed in KnowledgeBeast
- Query across all research: "What technologies require GPU acceleration?"
- Cross-reference: "Which tech radar items have completed research tasks?"
