# Roadmap

## Current Phase: Connect What Exists

**Status**: 20% complete

We're connecting existing components into a coherent system before building new features.

### This Week
- [ ] Wander Phase 0: Mind Map UI
- [ ] Wire KnowledgeBeast → Wander queries
- [ ] AI Arena results → KnowledgeBeast storage

### This Month
- [ ] Wander Phases 1-2: Basic dwelling, resonance detection
- [ ] VISLZR Sprint 3: Agent parity
- [ ] Voice input prototype

### This Quarter
- [ ] Wander crystallization
- [ ] MRKTZR CRM foundation
- [ ] Veria Polymarket integration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Connect What Exists (Current)
- Wire existing modules together
- Unified data flow through KnowledgeBeast
- VISLZR as primary human interface

### Phase 2: Close the Loop (Q1-Q2 2026)
- Wander → AI Arena → Prompt Improver flow
- Automatic improvement from operation
- Skills written back by agents

### Phase 3: Accelerate (Q2-Q3 2026)
- Background operation (runs while you sleep)
- Multi-agent coordination
- Self-healing infrastructure

### Phase 4: Economic Action (Q3-Q4 2026)
- Veria trading live
- MRKTZR campaigns autonomous
- Revenue generation

### Phase 5: Train the Substrate (2026-2027)
- Custom model training (nanochat-inspired)
- The Loop trains the models it runs on
- True self-improvement
