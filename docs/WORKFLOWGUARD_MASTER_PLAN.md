## 1. Product Vision

### The Problem

Knowledge workers face systematic inefficiencies:

1. **Context Switching Costs:** Average 23 minutes to regain focus after interruption
2. **Tool Discovery Gap:** Reinventing solutions when better tools exist
3. **Fatigue Blindness:** Unable to recognize declining performance
4. **Context Rot in AI:** Long conversations lose coherence, users don't notice
5. **Inefficient Tool Usage:** Using VS Code, terminal, or profession tools sub-optimally
6. **Technology Lag:** Building with outdated technology unknowingly

**Current solutions are reactive** - they wait for users to ask for help.

### The Solution

**WorkflowGuard: Proactive AI Work Intelligence**

An always-on AI observer that:
- Monitors your workflow (screen, terminal, files, voice)
- Detects patterns and inefficiencies in real-time
- Intervenes with gentle suggestions at optimal moments
- Learns profession-specific workflows through add-on packs

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Passive Observation:** No manual input required
2. **Privacy-First:** Local AI models, no data leaves your machine
3. **Cross-Profession:** Works for developers, accountants, lawyers, etc.
4. **Contextual Intelligence:** Understands your full workflow context
5. **Voice Interface:** Natural conversation, not just text
