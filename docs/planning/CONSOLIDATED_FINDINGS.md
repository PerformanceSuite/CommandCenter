## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Must Fix Before Production)

#### 1. **GitHub Tokens Stored Unencrypted** (Security Agent)
- **Impact:** HIGH - Credentials exposed in database
- **Location:** `backend/app/models/repository.py:36`
- **Issue:** Encryption code exists but is never used
- **Effort:** 2 hours
- **Fix:** Implement token encryption in repository create/update

#### 2. **No Authentication/Authorization** (Security Agent)
- **Impact:** CRITICAL - All API endpoints publicly accessible
- **Location:** All routers in `backend/app/routers/`
- **Issue:** Missing auth layer entirely
- **Effort:** 8 hours
- **Fix:** Implement JWT-based authentication

#### 3. **Zero Test Coverage on Frontend** (Testing Agent)
- **Impact:** HIGH - No validation of UI functionality
- **Location:** `frontend/src/` (0 test files)
- **Issue:** Testing infrastructure installed but unused
- **Effort:** 16 hours
- **Fix:** Create component, integration, and E2E tests

#### 4. **Minimal Backend Test Coverage (~5%)** (Testing Agent)
- **Impact:** HIGH - Critical paths untested
- **Location:** `backend/test_api.py` (only 4 smoke tests)
- **Issue:** GitHub sync, RAG, auth completely untested
- **Effort:** 24 hours
- **Fix:** Achieve 80% coverage with comprehensive test suite

#### 5. **No Rate Limiting** (Security Agent)
- **Impact:** HIGH - Vulnerable to DoS attacks
- **Location:** `backend/app/main.py`
- **Issue:** Missing rate limiting middleware
- **Effort:** 4 hours
- **Fix:** Add slowapi rate limiting

#### 6. **Weak Encryption Key Derivation** (Security Agent)
- **Impact:** HIGH - Tokens can be decrypted
- **Location:** `backend/app/utils/crypto.py:25-30`
- **Issue:** SECRET_KEY truncated/padded unsafely
- **Effort:** 1 hour
- **Fix:** Use PBKDF2 for key derivation

#### 7. **No CI/CD Pipeline** (DevOps Agent)
- **Impact:** HIGH - Manual deployments error-prone
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/` (doesn't exist)
- **Issue:** No automated testing or deployment
- **Effort:** 8 hours
- **Fix:** Implement GitHub Actions workflow

#### 8. **Blocking I/O in Async Functions** (Backend Agent)
- **Impact:** HIGH - Performance bottleneck
- **Location:** `backend/app/services/github_service.py` (all methods)
- **Issue:** PyGithub is synchronous, blocks event loop
- **Effort:** 12 hours
- **Fix:** Migrate to httpx or use thread pools
