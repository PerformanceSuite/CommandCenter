# Current Session

**Session Ended: 2025-10-30 07:40 UTC**

## Session Summary

**Branch:** feature/production-foundations (worktree: `.worktrees/production-foundations`)
**Duration:** ~12 minutes
**Focus:** Phase A: Dagger Production Hardening (Tasks 6-7 of 10)

### Work Completed

**Methodology:** Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- RED: Write failing test
- GREEN: Minimal implementation
- REFACTOR: (not needed for these tasks)

**Tasks Completed (20% of Phase A in this session):**

✅ **Task 6: Non-Root User Execution**
- Added user ID constants (Postgres: 999, Redis: 999, App: 1000)
- Applied `.with_user()` to postgres and redis container builds
- 1 security test passing
- Code review: Security hardening complete
- Commit: f5687d2

✅ **Task 7: Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff**
- Created `with_retry()` decorator with exponential backoff
- Applied to `start()` method (3 retries, delays: 1s, 2s, 4s)
- 3 unit tests passing (transient failure, backoff timing, max retries)
- Code review: Reliability improvement complete
- Commit: 629dc95

### Metrics

**Test Coverage:** +4 tests (36 total passing in Phase A)
- test_containers_run_as_non_root_user: PASS
- test_start_retries_on_transient_failure: PASS
- test_start_uses_exponential_backoff: PASS
- test_start_fails_after_max_retries: PASS

**Commits:** 2 commits this session (13 total in Phase A)
- f5687d2: Security hardening
- 629dc95: Retry logic

**Progress:** 70% complete (7/10 tasks done)
- Tasks 1-5: ✅ Complete (previous session)
- Tasks 6-7: ✅ Complete (this session)
- Tasks 8-10: ⏳ Remaining

### Key Technical Decisions

**Non-Root Execution:**
- Used UID 999 for postgres/redis (standard in alpine images)
- Used UID 1000 for backend/frontend (non-privileged)
- Hardens against container escape vulnerabilities

**Retry Logic:**
- Exponential backoff prevents thundering herd
- Max 3 retries balances reliability vs. timeout duration
- Decorator pattern keeps code clean and reusable

## Next Session Priorities

**Remaining Phase A Tasks (Week 3):**

1. **Task 8:** Service Restart Method (recovery) - ~20 minutes
2. **Task 9:** Update Documentation (DAGGER_ARCHITECTURE.md, SECURITY.md) - ~15 minutes
3. **Task 10:** Verify All Tests Pass (final validation) - ~10 minutes

**Estimated Time:** 45 minutes to complete Phase A

## Files Modified

**Source Files:**
- hub/backend/app/dagger_modules/commandcenter.py (security + retry logic)

**Test Files (Created):**
- hub/backend/tests/security/test_dagger_security.py (added non-root test)
- hub/backend/tests/unit/test_dagger_retry.py (created, 3 tests)

**Documentation:**
- None this session (Task 9 pending)

## Session Quality Metrics

**Code Quality:** High (TDD followed strictly)
**Test Coverage:** Comprehensive (all features tested)
**Process Adherence:** Excellent (RED-GREEN cycle enforced)
**Context Usage:** 50.5% (101k/200k tokens)

*Ready for next session: Use `/start` to continue Phase A implementation*
