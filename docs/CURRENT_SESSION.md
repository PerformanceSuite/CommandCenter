## Next Session Priorities

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:**

**Option 2: Create Feature Branch + Pull Request (RECOMMENDED)**

Execute these commands:
```bash
# 1. Create feature branch from current HEAD
git branch feature/phase-b-knowledge-ingestion

# 2. Reset local main to origin/main (preserves commits in feature branch)
git reset --hard origin/main

# 3. Push feature branch
git push -u origin feature/phase-b-knowledge-ingestion

# 4. Create Pull Request
gh pr create --title "Phase B: Automated Knowledge Ingestion System" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary

Implements Phase B of the production foundations: Automated Knowledge Ingestion System

### Components Implemented (6/6 Tasks)

- **Task 1:** Database models for ingestion sources (RSS, docs, webhooks, files)
- **Task 2:** RSS feed scraper with full content extraction
- **Task 3:** Documentation scraper with sitemap/robots.txt support
- **Task 4:** Webhook receivers (GitHub + generic)
- **Task 5:** File system watchers (PDF, DOCX, MD, TXT)
- **Task 6:** Source management REST API (CRUD + manual trigger)

### Security Enhancements

- SSRF protection for documentation scraper
- Path traversal prevention for file watchers
- File size limits (100MB default) to prevent DoS
- API key validation for generic webhooks
- HMAC SHA-256 signature verification for GitHub webhooks

### Test Coverage

- 50+ tests added (100% passing for implemented features)
- Unit tests for all services
- Integration tests for all APIs
- Security tests for validation logic

### Architecture

- Service-oriented pattern (routers â†’ services â†’ models)
- Async/await throughout (AsyncSession, Celery tasks)
- RAG integration for document storage
- Status tracking and error handling
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

## Test Plan

- [ ] Run full test suite in Docker environment
- [ ] Verify database migrations apply cleanly
- [ ] Test RSS feed ingestion end-to-end
- [ ] Test documentation scraping with public docs site
- [ ] Test webhook ingestion with sample payloads
- [ ] Test file watcher with sample documents
- [ ] Verify source management API endpoints
- [ ] Security audit: path traversal, SSRF, file size limits

## Breaking Changes

**Why Option 2?**
- Allows team code review via GitHub PR
- Enables CI/CD validation before merge
- Protects main branch from direct pushes
- Provides rollback path (close PR vs revert main)
- Best practice for team collaboration

### Alternative Options

**Option 1: Direct Push to Main** (Not Recommended)
```bash
git push origin main
```
- Bypasses code review
- No CI/CD validation
- Immediate production impact

**Option 3: Keep As-Is** (Defer Decision)
- Leave commits on local main
- Decide later

**Option 4: Discard** (Nuclear Option)
```bash
git reset --hard origin/main
# Loses all 14 commits - DO NOT USE
```
