# Current Session

**Session ended at**: 2025-10-27 14:35 PST
**Status**: USS /end command enhanced with auto-commit

## Last Completed
- ✅ Fixed USS /end command to auto-commit USS maintenance changes
- ✅ Added Step 7 "Commit USS Changes" to /end workflow
- ✅ Updated USS templates (current project, local, USS repo)
- ✅ Updated memory.md with session summary
- ✅ Created detailed session log

## Next Session Tasks
1. Test the fixed /end command (auto-commit validation)
2. Use `/re-init` on other projects to propagate the fix
3. Consider merging `feature/knowledgebeast-integration` → `main`
4. Update CLAUDE.md with pgvector deployment notes

## Notes
- /end now auto-commits USS changes (memory, docs, moved files)
- User work changes remain uncommitted for manual review
- Fix propagated to all USS templates
- Repository hygiene: ✅ CLEAN (no violations)

*Auto-cleared by /end, recreated by /start*
