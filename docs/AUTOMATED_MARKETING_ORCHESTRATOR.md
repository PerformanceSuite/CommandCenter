**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Executive Summary & Vision

### The Problem: The "Last Mile" of Innovation is Silence

R&D teams in CommandCenter produce valuable insights, adopt new technologies, and complete critical research. However, this value often remains locked within the engineering team. The "last mile" problem of innovation is communicating this work to the outside world—to customers, potential hires, investors, and the wider community. This communication, or marketing, is often manual, time-consuming, and disconnected from the R&D process itself.

### The Vision: Amplify Innovation, Automatically

The **Automated Marketing Orchestrator (AMO)** is a new, deeply integrated module for CommandCenter designed to solve this "last mile" problem. Its vision is to transform the outputs of R&D—completed research, adopted technologies, and key findings—into a wide array of marketing and communication assets, and to automate their dissemination.

AMO will act as a powerful **content amplifier**, turning a single piece of completed research into a blog post, a series of social media updates, a video script, and even a draft for a technical paper. It will bridge the gap between creation and communication, ensuring that the value generated within CommandCenter reaches its maximum audience with minimal manual effort.

## 2. Core Concepts & Philosophy

The AMO module is built on three core principles:

1.  **Content as a Byproduct of R&D:** High-quality marketing content should not be a separate, arduous task. It should be a natural, automated byproduct of the R&D work that teams are already doing in CommandCenter.
2.  **Event-Driven Marketing:** Marketing activities should be triggered by meaningful events in the development lifecycle. When a `ResearchTask` is completed or a `Technology` is moved to "Integrated," the marketing engine should spring to life.
3.  **Repurpose, Don't Re-create:** A single, well-documented research finding is a seed for a multitude of content formats. AMO's core function is to intelligently repurpose this seed content into formats optimized for different channels (blogs, Twitter, YouTube, etc.).

## 3. Deep Integration with CommandCenter

AMO's primary strength is its seamless integration with the existing data models and workflows of CommandCenter.

| Source in CommandCenter | Automated Marketing Action (Triggered by AMO) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Research Task** (Status → "Completed") | - **Generate Blog Post:** Use the `findings` and `description` to write a technical blog post. <br/> - **Create Social Media Campaign:** Generate a series of tweets or LinkedIn posts summarizing the key findings. <br/> - **Draft Technical Paper:** Format the research into a structured paper (e.g., LaTeX/Markdown) for submission to arXiv or conferences. |
| **Technology** (Status → "Integrated") | - **Generate "How We Built It" Article:** Detail the use case, integration difficulty, and benefits of the new technology. <br/> - **Create Announcement Posts:** Announce the adoption of the new technology on social media. |
| **Knowledge Base Entry** (New Document Added) | - **Generate "Key Takeaways" Post:** Create a short-form post summarizing a newly added PDF or document. |
| **Repository** (Major Release/Tag) | - **Draft Release Notes:** Use commit messages between tags to draft user-friendly release notes. <br/> - **Announce New Version:** Post on social media about the new release and its key features. |

## 4. Research & Competitive Landscape

The marketing automation space is mature, but no existing tool offers this level of integration with the R&D process.

-   **General Marketing Automation (e.g., HubSpot, Marketo):** These are focused on customer relationship management (CRM) and sales funnels. They are completely disconnected from the engineering lifecycle.
-   **Social Media Schedulers (e.g., Buffer, Hootsuite):** These tools are for scheduling and analytics, but they do not help with *content creation*. They are a potential integration point for AMO (as a "publisher"), not a competitor.
-   **AI Content Writers (e.g., Jasper, Copy.ai):** These are powerful tools for generating content from prompts, but they lack the context of the R&D process. A user has to manually copy-paste findings into them. AMO's advantage is its direct access to the source material.
-   **Zapier / IFTTT:** These are generic automation platforms. One could theoretically build a crude version of AMO by connecting multiple services, but it would be brittle, complex, and lack a central UI for management and content approval.

**Conclusion:** The unique value proposition of AMO is its **context-aware content generation and automation, triggered directly by the R&D lifecycle.**

## 5. Key Features

### 1. The Content Campaign Dashboard

A new top-level "Amplify" section in the CommandCenter UI where users can view, manage, and approve marketing campaigns that have been automatically generated by events.

-   **Campaign View:** Groups all content related to a single event (e.g., the "JUCE Framework Research" campaign contains a blog post, 5 tweets, and a video script).
-   **Content Editor:** A rich editor that allows users to review, edit, and approve AI-generated content before it's published.
-   **Scheduler:** A calendar interface to schedule the publication of approved content across different channels.

### 2. The Content Generation & Repurposing Engine

This is the core of AMO, powered by the flexible `ai_router` already in CommandCenter.

-   **Intelligent Prompting:** Uses the context from the triggering event (e.g., the `findings` of a `ResearchTask`) to generate high-quality, context-aware prompts for the LLM.
-   **Multi-Format Output:** Can generate content in various formats from a single source:
    -   Long-form (blog post, paper)
    -   Short-form (tweets, LinkedIn posts)
    -   Script-form (YouTube video script with suggested scenes)
-   **Tone & Style Configuration:** Users can configure the desired tone (e.g., "Formal and academic" for a paper, "Enthusiastic and engaging" for a tweet).

### 3. Pluggable "Publisher" Integrations

AMO will feature a provider-based model for connecting to external platforms.

-   **Social Media:**
    -   **Direct Integration:** Native APIs for platforms like X (Twitter) and LinkedIn.
    -   **Aggregator Integration:** Connect to services like **Buffer** or **Hootsuite** to manage multiple platforms from one place.
-   **Blogging Platforms:**
    -   **API Integration:** Connect to WordPress, Medium, or dev.to to publish drafts automatically.
    -   **Markdown/HTML Export:** For platforms without APIs.
-   **Video Generation (Future):**
    -   **API Integration:** Connect to AI video generation services like **Synthesia** or **HeyGen** to turn a generated script into a video with an AI avatar.

### 4. Technical Paper & Blog Post Formatter

-   **Structured Output:** Generates long-form content with proper structure (Introduction, Methodology, Results, Conclusion).
-   **Format Conversion:** Can output content in Markdown, HTML, or even generate a basic **LaTeX** structure for academic papers.
-   **Citation Support:** Can pull from URLs in the research notes to create a bibliography.

## 6. Proposed Architecture & Implementation

### Backend

-   **New Models:**
    -   `MarketingCampaign`: To group content related to a single trigger event.
    -   `ContentPiece`: Represents a single piece of generated content (e.g., a blog post, a tweet). Stores the draft, the final version, its status (draft, approved, published), and the target platform.
    -   `PublisherConfiguration`: To securely store API keys and settings for external services (e.g., Buffer, Twitter).
-   **New Service (`MarketingOrchestratorService`):**
    -   Contains the business logic for handling trigger events, generating content, and interacting with publisher services.
    -   Will be an `async` service capable of handling long-running generation tasks in the background.
-   **New API Router (`/marketing`):**
    -   Endpoints for managing campaigns, approving content, and configuring publishers.
-   **Database Changes:**
    -   Add a `marketing_campaign_id` to `ResearchTask` and other trigger models to link them to the generated content.

### Frontend

-   **New Top-Level Route (`/amplify`):**
    -   Will house the Campaign Dashboard.
-   **New Components:**
    -   `CampaignKanbanView`: To visualize campaigns and their content pieces.
    -   `ContentEditor`: A rich text editor for approving AI-generated content.
    -   `PublisherSettings`: A view for adding and configuring integrations with external services.

1.  **Backend:**
    -   Implement the `MarketingCampaign` and `ContentPiece` models.
    -   Build the core `MarketingOrchestratorService` with a trigger for "Research Task Completed."
    -   Implement the content generation engine for two formats: a **Markdown blog post** and a **series of tweets**.
2.  **Frontend:**
    -   Create a basic Campaign Dashboard that lists generated content.
    -   Build a simple viewer that allows a user to see the generated Markdown/text.
    -   Implement "Copy to Clipboard" buttons for each content piece.
3.  **Outcome:** Users can complete a research task and immediately get a high-quality blog post and a set of tweets that they can manually post. This proves the core value proposition without the complexity of external API integrations.

### Phase 2: Automated Publishing

**Goal:** Close the loop by automating the dissemination of content.

1.  **Backend:**
    -   Implement the `PublisherConfiguration` model to store API keys.
    -   Build the first "Publisher" integration (e.g., Twitter API).
    -   Add a scheduler (e.g., using `apscheduler`) to handle scheduled posts.
2.  **Frontend:**
    -   Build the UI for configuring publishers.
    -   Add "Approve & Schedule" functionality to the content editor.
    -   Create a calendar view to show scheduled and published content.

### Phase 3: Expansion & Intelligence

**Goal:** Expand to more channels and add more intelligent features.

1.  **Integrations:** Add more publishers (LinkedIn, Medium, Buffer). Explore AI video generation APIs (Synthesia, HeyGen).
2.  **Analytics:** Add a feedback loop. Track metrics like likes and shares to understand which types of research generate the most engagement.
3.  **More Triggers:** Add triggers for other CommandCenter events (e.g., Technology adoption, new repository releases).
