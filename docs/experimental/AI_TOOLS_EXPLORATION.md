# AI Tools & Dev Tools UI - Experimental

**Status:** Experimental (Not production)
**Branch:** experimental/ai-dev-tools-ui
**Created:** 2025-10-09
**Decision:** Hold for future review
**Commit:** dd511d9

## What Was Built

### AI Tools Management Interface
- **Dashboard Overview:** Real-time status of all AI tools with quick stats
- **Gemini API Integration:** Direct query interface with CLI and testing tools
- **UI Testing Automation:** Gemini-powered UI testing with computer-use capabilities
- **CodeMender Preparation:** Structure ready for Google DeepMind's security agent (awaiting public release)
- **Security Scanning Interface:** Vulnerability detection and tracking UI
- **Interactive Console:** Browser-based terminal for AI tool commands
- **NLTK Integration:** Natural language processing toolkit with pre-loaded data

### Developer Tools Hub
- **Multi-Model Provider Support:**
  - Claude (Anthropic) - MCP support, projects, artifacts
  - OpenAI - GPT-4, GPT-3.5, DALL-E, embeddings
  - Google Gemini - Multimodal, long context, function calling
  - Ollama - Local models (Llama 2, Mistral, CodeLlama)
  - LM Studio - Any GGUF model with GPU acceleration

- **MCP Server Management:**
  - Filesystem operations
  - GitHub integration
  - Brave Search
  - Puppeteer browser automation
  - Desktop Commander
  - Git operations

- **Code Assistants:**
  - Claude Code
  - Goose AI pair programmer
  - Codex code generation
  - Jules Helper task management

- **GitHub Operations Panel:**
  - Repository management (create, fork, clone)
  - Pull requests (create, review, merge)
  - Issues management
  - Actions monitoring
  - Collaborator management
  - Webhooks
  - Security scanning

- **Workflow Automation:**
  - Development flow (Code → Test → Review → Deploy)
  - Security scan pipeline
  - Documentation generation
  - Custom workflow creation

### Development Workflow Tools
- **LiteLLM Proxy:** Multi-provider API proxy with unified interface
- **CLI Tools:** Interactive LLM CLI with session management
- **Session Management:** Memory, history, and context tracking
- **Examples:** Curl examples for Gemini and OpenAI integration

## Why Experimental?

### Not in Original Roadmap
- Phase 0/1a focused on security review and VIZTRTR MCP server
- This work was exploratory, not part of planned deliverables
- Risk of scope creep and distraction from core goals

### CodeMender Not Released
- Key security feature depends on Google DeepMind's upcoming release
- Unknown timeline for public availability
- Cannot test or validate integration until release

### Needs Product Review
- Unclear if this fits CommandCenter's vision as R&D knowledge base
- May overlap with existing tools (Claude Code CLI, MCP servers)
- Question: Should CommandCenter have a UI for these tools, or focus on MCP server development?

### Testing Required
- No test coverage (frontend or backend)
- No integration tests
- No E2E tests
- Security implications not validated

### Documentation Gaps
- Architecture not documented
- API contracts not formalized
- Deployment strategy undefined
- Configuration management unclear

### Technical Concerns
- Large binary files committed (NLTK data - 2.3M+ insertions)
- Should use .gitignore for data files
- Dependencies not properly documented
- Environment setup not tested

## Future Consideration

### Phase 1c/2 Inclusion Evaluation

**Questions to Answer:**
1. **Fit with MCP Architecture:** Does a web UI add value over direct MCP server usage?
2. **vs Building MCP Servers:** Should we build MCP servers instead of UI wrappers?
3. **Security Model:** How do we secure multi-provider API keys in web UI?
4. **Deployment:** How does this fit with CommandCenter's per-project isolation requirement?
5. **Maintenance:** Who will maintain this as AI provider APIs evolve?

**Scenarios for Promotion to Production:**

**Scenario A: UI-First Approach**
- If users prefer web UI over CLI for AI tool management
- If we add significant value beyond raw MCP servers (analytics, orchestration)
- If we can demonstrate clear workflow improvements

**Scenario B: MCP-First Approach**
- Build dedicated MCP servers for each provider
- Let users access via Claude Code CLI directly
- Focus CommandCenter on knowledge base and research tracking only

**Scenario C: Hybrid Approach**
- Keep CommandCenter focused on R&D knowledge base
- Build separate project for AI tool orchestration
- Share common MCP servers between projects

### Production Requirements (if promoted)

**Testing:**
- [ ] Frontend unit tests (Jest, React Testing Library)
- [ ] Backend unit tests (pytest)
- [ ] Integration tests for each provider
- [ ] E2E tests for critical workflows
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent model usage

**Security:**
- [ ] Security review of API key storage
- [ ] Audit of command execution sandboxing
- [ ] Review of GitHub token permissions
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 compliance check
- [ ] Rate limiting per provider

**Architecture:**
- [ ] Document service architecture
- [ ] Define API contracts (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Create deployment diagrams
- [ ] Document data flow
- [ ] Define error handling strategy

**Documentation:**
- [ ] User guide for each feature
- [ ] Developer setup guide
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Configuration reference
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

**Integration:**
- [ ] Integration with existing CommandCenter auth
- [ ] Deployment configuration (Docker)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Backup/restore procedures

**Performance:**
- [ ] Response time benchmarks

## Decision Log

### 2025-10-09: Moved to Experimental Branch

**Decision Maker:** Documentation Agent (Phase 1a cleanup)

**Rationale:**
1. **Not part of Phase 0/1a plan** - These features were exploratory work, not planned deliverables
2. **No blocker for Phase 1a completion** - Work can be preserved without blocking roadmap
3. **CodeMender not available** - Cannot validate key security feature
4. **Needs architecture review** - Significant technical questions remain
5. **Safe to defer** - Can revisit in Phase 1c or Phase 2 after MCP architecture solidifies

**Impact:**
- Phase 1a can complete without this work
- Features preserved for future evaluation
- Git working tree cleaned for Phase 1b work

**Next Steps:**
- Complete Phase 1a (security PR merge, VIZTRTR PR merge)
- Complete Phase 1b (MCP architecture planning)
- Revisit in Phase 1c with clear decision criteria

### Evaluation Criteria for Future Review

When reconsidering this work, evaluate against:

1. **Strategic Fit:**
   - Does it align with CommandCenter's mission?
   - Is there user demand?
   - Does it differentiate from existing tools?

2. **Technical Merit:**
   - Clean architecture?
   - Maintainable code?
   - Proper error handling?

3. **Resource Requirements:**
   - Development time to production-ready?
   - Ongoing maintenance burden?
   - Documentation effort?

4. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Security implications?
   - Deployment complexity?
   - Dependency management?

5. **Alternatives:**
   - Could we achieve the same with MCP servers?
   - Is there an existing tool we should integrate instead?
   - Should this be a separate project?

## Notes

- This represents significant exploratory work (~100 files)
- Shows initiative but needs product alignment
- Good learning exercise for MCP integration
- May inform future MCP server development
- NLTK data should be removed/gitignored if promoted
