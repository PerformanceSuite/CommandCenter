# Solana Blueprint for CommandCenter

**Positioning:** Solana as the high‑performance *execution* layer that feeds real‑time, low‑latency
market and compliance signals into CommandCenter → Mesh‑Bus → Veria.

**Layer roles (concise):**
- **Bitcoin** = Store of Value (digital gold / vault)
- **Ethereum** = Settlement (global court / finality)
- **Solana** = Execution (financial CPU / high‑throughput runtime)

**Why Solana here**
- Near‑instant, low‑fee transactions suited for continuous monitoring.
- Fits Veria’s “compliance middleware” by exposing deterministic, programmable flows.
- Aligns with agentic pipelines where AI actors need machine‑speed execution venues.

**Core data planes integrated**
- Account/state watchers for programs relevant to compliance (stablecoins, venues, custody)
- Transaction stream with finality classification
- Latency, health and RPC SLO metrics

**Event flow**
Solana RPC/WebSocket → Adapter → Mesh‑Bus (NATS/JSON‑RPC) → TaskGraph actions → Veria UI and alerts.
