**Core Thesis:**  
MRKTZR transforms outreach and business development into an intelligent, autonomous system. It not only markets products but also identifies, validates, and structures mutually beneficial partnerships — from code-level integrations to full M&A alignments.

**Modules:**  
- Campaign Mesh – Autonomous agents execute cross-channel marketing campaigns (email, social, content, PR).  
- MarketGraph – Continuously maps industry relationships, product overlaps, and engagement signals.  
- Interactive Outreach Engine – Generates contextual PRs or Issues in partner repos (with consent), creating direct, value-first contact in developer ecosystems.  
- Partnership Streamliner – AI framework to evaluate and design partnerships:  
  - Compares objectives, markets, and tech stacks.  
  - Scores synergy, overlap, and strategic benefit.  
  - Generates partnership blueprints (e.g., integrations, co-marketing, licensing).  
  - Optionally deploys Smart Contract Templates to formalize collaboration terms.  
- Compliance Bridge – Ensures all messaging and contracts align with Veria’s regulatory and trust frameworks.

- ROLLIZR – Feeds company intelligence and consolidation opportunities.  
- Performia – Provides creative content and product experiences for campaigns or partnerships.  
- CommandCenter / AEYE – Central control of all MRKTZR agents and performance metrics.
