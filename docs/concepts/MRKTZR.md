# MRKTZR — AI Marketing and Partnership Intelligence

**Core Thesis:**
MRKTZR transforms outreach and business development into an intelligent, autonomous system. It not only markets products but also identifies, validates, and structures mutually beneficial partnerships — from code-level integrations to full M&A alignments.

- MarketGraph – Continuously maps industry relationships, product overlaps, and engagement signals.
- Interactive Outreach Engine – Generates contextual PRs or Issues in partner repos (with consent), creating direct, value-first contact in developer ecosystems.
- Partnership Streamliner – AI framework to evaluate and design partnerships:
  - Compares objectives, markets, and tech stacks.
  - Scores synergy, overlap, and strategic benefit.
  - Generates partnership blueprints (e.g., integrations, co-marketing, licensing).
  - Optionally deploys Smart Contract Templates to formalize collaboration terms.
- Compliance Bridge – Ensures all messaging and contracts align with Veria’s regulatory and trust frameworks.
