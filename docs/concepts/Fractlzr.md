# Fractlzr — Fractal-Based Secure Encoding

**Core Thesis:**  
Fractlzr explores embedding secure or meaningful information within fractal images. It uses fractal geometry as a cryptographic and steganographic medium to store data, identity signatures, or trust markers that can be interpreted by AI systems.

**Modules:**  
- Fractal Generator – Creates multi-layer fractal patterns capable of encoding metadata.  
- Information Encoder – Maps structured data into fractal parameters.  
- AI Decoder – Reconstructs meaning or data from visual inputs.  
- Compliance Mode – Enables verifiable watermarking of compliant assets (e.g., Veria documents).  

**Integration Points:**  
- Veria – Adds visual compliance watermarks.  
- MRKTZR – Watermarks creative assets and proposals.  
- Performia – Embeds identity cues in visuals or video backdrops.  

**Strategic Positioning:**  
- Experimental technology with high long-term potential for secure, aesthetic data embedding.
