# CommandCenter Development Memory

This file tracks project history, decisions, and context across sessions.

## Session: 2025-10-28 12:12 PST (LATEST)
**Branch**: main
**Duration**: ~30 minutes

### Work Completed:
- ✅ **Branch Consolidation Plan Execution**
  - Merged feature/dagger-orchestration (13 commits, 28 files, +2,838 -886)
  - Cherry-picked backend DB session fix (6 files, +165 -203)
  - Hub now uses Dagger SDK instead of docker-compose subprocesses
  - Fixed critical DB session bug and implemented BaseRepository pattern

- ✅ **Agent Services Deferred**
  - Created GitHub Issues #56-58 for tracking deferred branches
  - Tagged branches: deferred-agent-*-20251028
  - Documented re-evaluation criteria (2-4 weeks after Hub stabilization)

- ✅ **Verification & Testing**
  - Hub health check: PASS
  - Hub projects API: PASS
  - Hub template version endpoint: PASS
  - Backend Docker build: PASS
  - Frontend Docker build: PASS

### Key Decisions:
- Defer 3 agent service branches (CLI, MCP, Analyzer) pending core stabilization
- Prioritize Hub Dagger orchestration and backend fixes over new features
- All critical infrastructure consolidated (15 commits merged to main)

### Commits:
- `60ad96b` - docs: Add branch consolidation report
- `6a675b9` - refactor(backend): Fix DB session bug and implement repository pattern
- `52fd372` - feat(hub): Merge Dagger SDK orchestration (includes 13 commits from feature branch)

### GitHub Issues Created:
- [#56](https://github.com/PerformanceSuite/CommandCenter/issues/56): Agent Services: Professional CLI Interface
- [#57](https://github.com/PerformanceSuite/CommandCenter/issues/57): Agent Services: MCP Core Infrastructure
- [#58](https://github.com/PerformanceSuite/CommandCenter/issues/58): Agent Services: Project Analyzer Service

### Documentation Created:
- `docs/CONSOLIDATION_REPORT.md` - Complete consolidation summary with verification results
- `docs/DAGGER_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Hub Dagger SDK architecture (from feature branch)
- `docs/TASK_10_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` - Dagger branch test results (9/9 passing)

### Next Steps:
1. Test Hub project creation with Dagger SDK in production
2. Deploy CommandCenter instances to test projects
3. Monitor Hub stability over 24-48 hours
4. Re-evaluate deferred agent services after 2-4 weeks
5. Clean up remaining stale branches (knowledgebeast-migration-docker-fix, experimental/ai-dev-tools-ui)

### Blockers/Issues:
- None - all critical work completed successfully

### Technical Notes:
- Hub orchestration now type-safe with Dagger SDK (replaces subprocess docker-compose calls)
- Removed setup_service.py (211 lines) - no more git clone approach
- Simplified Project model (removed cc_path, compose_project_name fields)
- DB session management improved - explicit commits prevent data loss
- BaseRepository pattern reduces code duplication across repositories
