## Session: 2025-10-27 12:33 PST (15 min)
**Branch**: feature/knowledgebeast-integration
**Context Usage**: 122k/200k tokens (61%)

### Work Completed:
- ✅ **Fixed KnowledgeBeast PostgresBackend query unpacking error**
  - **Root Cause 1**: Query methods not SELECTing `document` column
  - **Root Cause 2**: Metadata returned as JSON string instead of dict
  - **Root Cause 3**: Expected 4-tuple `(id, score, metadata, document)` but got 3-tuple

- ✅ **Applied comprehensive fixes to KnowledgeBeast**:
  - Added `document` to SELECT in `query_vector()` and `query_keyword()`
  - Updated `query_hybrid()` to handle 4-tuple results from sub-queries
  - Added JSON deserialization for metadata in both query methods
  - Updated type hints in `base.py` to reflect 4-tuple returns
  - Updated all docstrings to document new format

- ✅ **Verified end-to-end functionality**
  - Manual query test PASSED with document content + metadata
  - Query endpoint returns proper JSON response
  - Metadata correctly deserialized as dict (not string)

### Key Decisions:
- Fixed KnowledgeBeast source at `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/KnowledgeBeast/`
- Changed API contract: 3-tuple → 4-tuple to include document text
- asyncpg JSONB deserialization handled manually (not automatic in this context)

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ READY: Merge knowledgebeast-integration to main
2. Update CLAUDE.md with pgvector requirement documentation
3. Run full integration test suite once pytest is configured
4. Consider updating ChromaDBBackend to match 4-tuple format for consistency

### Technical Notes:
- Files modified: `KnowledgeBeast/knowledgebeast/backends/{postgres.py,base.py}`
- API change: All query methods now return `(id, score, metadata, document)`
- Docker build context: `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/` (accesses both repos)

## Previous Context

### KnowledgeBeast v3.0 Integration Design (2025-10-26)
- Architecture complete: PostgresBackend replaces ChromaDB
- Database schema with pgvector + full-text search (GIN indexes)
- Hybrid search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- Multi-tenant via collection prefixes (project_{id})
- Dagger modules created for Postgres custom builds

### Universal Session System v2.1 (2025-10-23)
- /start, /end, /init-project commands
- Auto-rotation at 500 lines
- 5-document structure
- MCP optimization for context management

---

## Session: 2025-10-27 13:18 PST (30 min)
**Branch**: main
**Context Usage**: 82k/200k tokens (41%)

### Work Completed:
- ✅ **Fixed repository-hygiene skill using TDD methodology**
  - RED: Documented production failure (12 .md files + 5 session-* scripts missed during /end)
  - GREEN: Added explicit verification commands and allowed file lists
  - REFACTOR: Documented baseline failure, added rationalization counters
  - Updated skill globally at `~/.claude/skills/repository-hygiene/SKILL.md`

- ✅ **Created /re-init command for selective USS updates**
  - Terminal: `re-init` (alias in ~/.zshrc)
  - Claude: `/re-init`
  - Preserves docs/* and .claude/memory.md
  - Updates only USS infrastructure (commands, scripts, cleanup)
  - Added to USS template for future projects

- ✅ **Repository hygiene cleanup**
  - Moved 12 documentation files from root to docs/
  - Moved 5 session-* scripts from root to scripts/
  - Root directory now clean (only allowed files)

### Key Decisions:
- `/init-project` = Full reset (overwrites docs)
- `/re-init` = Selective update (preserves content)
- repository-hygiene skill now has mandatory verification checklist
- Blocked rationalization: "Cleanup script will handle it"

### Next Steps:
1. Use `/re-init` on other projects to get updated USS features
2. Consider merging feature/knowledgebeast-integration branch
3. Update CLAUDE.md with pgvector deployment notes

### Files Modified:
- `~/.claude/skills/repository-hygiene/SKILL.md`
- `~/.claude/templates/USS_v2.1/commands/re-init.md`
- `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/universal-session-system/init.sh`
- `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/universal-session-system/re-init.sh`
- Moved 17 files to proper locations (docs/, scripts/)

## Session: 2025-10-27 14:30 PST (Brief)
**Branch**: main
**Context Usage**: ~60k/200k tokens (30%)

### Work Completed:
- ✅ **Executed /end command with full repository hygiene**
  - Ran cleanup.sh successfully
  - Moved 5 session-* scripts from root to scripts/
  - Verified no documentation files in root
  - Verified no test scripts in root
  - Scanned for debug statements (703 occurrences, mostly in dependencies/docs/examples)
  - Scanned for secrets (2153 occurrences, all in config templates/examples - no actual secrets)
  - Verified .env is properly gitignored
  - All TODOs have proper format

### Repository Status:
- **Staged Changes**: 12 file moves (documentation to docs/)
- **Unstaged Changes**: 6 files (.claude config, docker-compose, session docs)
- **Hygiene Score**: ✅ Clean (no violations found)
- **Root Directory**: Clean (only allowed files)

### Next Steps:
1. Use `/re-init` on other projects to propagate USS updates
2. Consider merging feature/knowledgebeast-integration → main
3. Update CLAUDE.md with pgvector deployment notes
4. Run full integration test suite (configure pytest in container)

## Session: 2025-10-27 14:35 PST (5 min)
**Branch**: main
**Context Usage**: ~75k/200k tokens (38%)

### Work Completed:
- ✅ **Fixed USS /end command - auto-commit functionality**
  - **Problem Found**: /end was leaving USS changes uncommitted (memory.md, docs, moved scripts)
  - **Root Cause**: Missing step to commit USS maintenance changes
  - **Fix Applied**: Added Step 7 "Commit USS Changes" to /end command
  - Auto-commits USS changes with standard message
  - Separates USS commits from user work commits

- ✅ **Updated USS templates**
  - Current project: `.claude/commands/end.md`
  - Local template: `~/.claude/templates/USS_v2.1/commands/end.md`
  - USS repo: `~/Projects/universal-session-system/templates/commands/end.md`

### Key Decisions:
- /end will auto-commit USS-related changes (memory, logs, hygiene moves)
- User work changes remain uncommitted for manual review
- Clear separation and reporting of what was committed vs needs attention

### Next Steps:
1. Test the fixed /end command (this session)
2. Use /re-init on other projects to get the fix
3. Merge feature/knowledgebeast-integration → main
4. Update CLAUDE.md with pgvector deployment notes

### Technical Notes:
- USS maintenance should be invisible/automatic
- User work should always require explicit review/commit
- /end now completes the full cleanup workflow

---

## Session: 2025-10-27 14:23 PST (Brief)
**Branch**: main

### Work Completed:
- ✅ **Tested improved /end command with repository-hygiene skill**
  - Skill automatically invoked by /end command
  - Found and moved 5 session-* scripts from root to scripts/
  - Verified no documentation files in root
  - Verified no test scripts in root
  - Repository hygiene audit completed successfully

### Repository Status:
- **Hygiene Score**: ✅ Clean
- **Root Directory**: Clean (only allowed files)
- **USS Changes**: Ready to commit (moved scripts, updated memory)

### Next Steps:
1. Continue merging feature/knowledgebeast-integration → main
2. Update CLAUDE.md with pgvector deployment notes
3. Run full integration test suite

---

## Session: 2025-10-27 14:45 PST (10 min)
**Branch**: main

### Work Completed:
- ✅ **Fixed /end command misleading messaging**
  - **Problem**: Said "Your work changes remain uncommitted" even when no work was done in session
  - **Fix**: Changed to "Note: [count] files remain uncommitted (may be from previous sessions)"
  - Updated all three templates (project, local, USS repo)
  - More accurate about pre-existing uncommitted changes vs session work

### Key Decisions:
- Messaging should distinguish between session work and pre-existing changes
- Avoid confusion about whether /end completed successfully

### Next Steps:
1. Use `/re-init` on other projects to propagate the fix
2. Merge feature/knowledgebeast-integration → main
3. Update CLAUDE.md with pgvector deployment notes
