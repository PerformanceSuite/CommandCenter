# CommandCenter Project Memory

## Session: 2025-10-30 16:40-17:30 PDT (LATEST)
**Duration**: ~50 minutes
**Branch**: main (clean, synced with origin)

### Work Completed:
**PR #63 Creation & Code Review - Phase B Complete**

✅ **Pull Request Created**
- Created feature branch `feature/phase-b-knowledge-ingestion`
- Reset main to origin/main (clean separation)
- Pushed 15 commits to feature branch
- Created PR #63: https://github.com/PerformanceSuite/CommandCenter/pull/63
- Stats: +10,351 additions, -20 deletions, 31 files changed

- Analyzed architecture and design patterns
- Reviewed security implementations (SSRF, path traversal, file size limits)
- Assessed test coverage (50+ tests)
- Identified 4 critical issues requiring fixes
- Documented 3 optional follow-up recommendations

✅ **Critical Fixes Applied (Commit 4370df4)**
- **Issue #1**: Memory leak in file watcher debounce dict → Auto-cleanup (1000 entries, 1hr TTL)
- **Issue #2**: Missing transaction rollback → Added `await db.rollback()` in 4 error handlers
- **Issue #3**: Deprecated datetime usage → Replaced `datetime.utcnow()` with `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`

**Duration**: ~15 minutes (bash shell failure)
**Branch**: main

### Work Completed:
- Ran `/start`, loaded superpowers skills

---

## Session: 2025-10-29 15:30-15:47 PDT
**Duration**: ~17 minutes
**Branch**: main

### Work Completed:
- Started session with /start, reviewed project status
- Read and analyzed two roadmap documents:
  - `docs/plans/2025-10-29-ecosystem-integration-roadmap.md`
  - `docs/plans/2025-10-29-commandcenter-habit-coach-feature-request.md`
- Identified significant infrastructure overlap between roadmaps
- **Infrastructure Assessment** (via Explore agent):
  - Dagger orchestration: PARTIAL (basic, needs production hardening)
  - KnowledgeBeast/RAG: FUNCTIONAL (v3.0, production-ready)
  - Scheduled Jobs (Celery): PRODUCTION-READY ✅
  - Knowledge Ingestion: PARTIAL (manual API only, no automation)
- Conducted brainstorming session using superpowers:brainstorming skill
- Validated three-phase sequential design for production-grade foundations

### Key Decisions:
- **Scope**: Foundation layer only (infrastructure hardening, not full feature roadmap)
- **Timeline**: Flexible/iterative (no hard deadline)
- **Team**: Solo developer + AI assistance
- **Success Criteria**: Production-grade foundations before building Habit Coach/ecosystem features
- **Approach**: Sequential Component Hardening (complete each 100% before moving on)
- **Three-Phase Plan**:
  - Phase A: Dagger Production Hardening (Weeks 1-3)
  - Phase B: Automated Knowledge Ingestion (Weeks 4-6)
  - Phase C: Observability Layer (Weeks 7-9)

### Design Validated (4 Sections):
1. Overall architecture & sequencing
2. Phase A details (log retrieval, health checks, resource limits, security)
3. Phase B details (Celery tasks, feed scrapers, webhooks, file watchers)
4. Phase C details (Prometheus, Grafana, tracing, alerting, analytics)

### Next Steps:
1. **Write comprehensive design document** to `docs/plans/2025-10-29-production-foundations-design.md`
2. Set up git worktree for implementation
3. Create detailed implementation plan via superpowers:writing-plans
4. Begin Phase A implementation

### Status:
- Brainstorming: COMPLETE ✅
- Design validation: COMPLETE ✅
- Design documentation: IN PROGRESS (interrupted by /end)

## Session: 2025-10-29 19:15 PDT
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Branch**: main (pushed to origin)

### Work Completed:
- ✅ **Fixed all 28 failing tests** through architectural refactoring
- ✅ Extracted hooks: `useResearchSummary`, `useResearchTaskList`
- ✅ Refactored components: ResearchSummary (-49 lines), ResearchTaskList (-69 lines)
- ✅ Updated all tests to mock hooks instead of fake timers
- ✅ Test results: 22/22 research tests passing (100% success)
- ✅ Overall suite: 130/145 tests passing (89.7%)

### Key Decisions:
- Architectural refactoring over fake timer workarounds
- Followed existing `useDashboard` hook pattern
- Separated concerns: hooks (business logic) + components (rendering)
- Eliminated fake timers entirely from tests
- Fixed stale closure in useResearchTaskList

### Approach - Subagent-Driven Development:
- Used superpowers:subagent-driven-development skill
- Executed 7 tasks with code review after each
- Iterative fixes applied when issues found
- TDD methodology throughout
