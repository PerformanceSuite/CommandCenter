## Tracking Your Own Requests

When making API calls, track them using the `track_request` tool:

```json
{
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "input_tokens": 1000,
  "output_tokens": 500,
  "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",

}
```

This ensures accurate usage and cost tracking.

## Understanding the Data

- **Input tokens**: Tokens sent to the API (your prompt)
- **Output tokens**: Tokens generated by the API (response)
- **Total cost**: Calculated based on provider pricing
- **Success rate**: Percentage of successful requests
