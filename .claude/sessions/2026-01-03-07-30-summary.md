## What Was Accomplished

### Phase 2 & 3: Parallel Agent Skill Documentation
- Merged PRs #124, #125 (Phase 2): repository-hygiene and infrastructure-decisions examples
- Merged PRs #126-#130 (Phase 3): 5 parallel agents added +4,211 lines to skills
  - autonomy: +653 lines (real-world examples)
  - context-management: +478 lines (decision tree)
  - project-health: +1,510 lines (assessment examples)
  - agent-sandboxes: +793 lines (troubleshooting)
  - skill-combinations: +777 lines (NEW cross-reference guide)

### Sprint 4 Verification
- Confirmed Sprint 4 (Real-time Subscriptions) is COMPLETE
- All 6 tasks implemented: SSE endpoint, subscription manager, frontend hooks, UI integration
- Updated ROADMAP.md: Status 35% → 45%, Sprint 4 marked complete

### Phase 4: Learning Validation (KEY MILESTONE)
- Ran 5 agents on REAL TASKS (not just documentation)
- Each agent used a specific skill to complete work
- Each agent reported what worked/failed about the skill
- 4/5 branches pushed successfully

**Phase 4 Results:**
| Agent | Skill | Real Work | Cost |
|-------|-------|-----------|------|
| 1 | project-health | 625-line services audit | $0.96 |
| 2 | repository-hygiene | 14 files cleaned from root | $0.65 |
| 3 | autonomy | 4 docstrings enhanced | $0.73 |
| 4 | context-management | 581-line routers review | $0.77 |
| 5 | infrastructure-decisions | (didn't push) | $0.46 |

**Total Phase 4 Cost: ~$3.57**

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Accelerated Dev Plan VALIDATED**: The full loop works:
   - Agents can read skills
   - Agents can complete real tasks
   - Agents can identify skill gaps
   - Agents can propose improvements

2. **Learning Loop Proven**: Agents provide actionable feedback:
   - project-health: 5 gaps (test dirs, duplicates, large files)
   - repository-hygiene: 5 gaps (conflicts, archives, .gitignore)
   - autonomy: 4 gaps (non-Ralph patterns, sandbox agents)
   - context-management: 32-47% token savings reported

3. **Token injection fix confirmed**: `${GITHUB_TOKEN}` with double braces works

## Current State of Work

### Branches Ready for Review/Merge
- `phase4/task-1-project-health-audit` - services health audit + feedback
- `phase4/task-2-repository-hygiene-cleanup` - actual cleanup + feedback
- `phase4/task-3-autonomy-docstrings` - docstrings + feedback
- `phase4/task-4-context-management-review` - routers review + feedback

### Files Modified This Session
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` - Updated to 45%, Sprint 4 complete
- `skills/` - +4,211 lines across 5 skills (Phase 3)
- `tools/agent-sandboxes/apps/sandbox_workflows/prompts/phase4-learning/` - 5 new prompts

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create PRs for Phase 4 branches** (4 branches ready)
2. **Apply skill improvements** based on agent feedback
3. **Run Phase 5**: Agents that improve skills based on their own feedback
4. **Move to roadmap priorities**: Document Intelligence E2E, VISLZR

## Open Questions

1. Should skill improvements be applied manually or via another agent batch?
2. Is the learning loop mature enough to run continuously?
3. What's the right balance between skill improvement and roadmap work?

## Session Metrics

- PRs Merged: 7 (#124-#125, #126-#130)
- Lines Added to Skills: +4,211
- Parallel Agents Run: 13 total (3 Phase 2 + 5 Phase 3 + 5 Phase 4)
- Total API Cost (Phase 4 only): ~$3.57
- Success Rate: Phase 2: 67%, Phase 3: 100%, Phase 4: 80%
