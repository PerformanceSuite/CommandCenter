## What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1 Verification & Fixes
1. **Pushed Phase 1 to main** (`66777b2`) - Composable CommandCenter foundation
2. **Fixed NATS configuration issues:**
   - Added `nats_url` to Settings class (`backend/app/config.py`)
   - Added `NATS_URL=nats://nats:4222` to `.env.docker`
   - Made migration `b1c2d3e4f5a6` idempotent (skip if `graph_links` table doesn't exist)
3. **Verified services running:**
   - Backend, frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis, NATS, orchestration all healthy
   - SSE endpoint working: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/events/stream`
   - NATS connected successfully

### Test Suite Results
- **703 passed**, 249 failed (pre-existing issues, not Phase 1)
- **Phase 1 specific tests:**
  - CrossProjectLink: 5/5 passed
  - Graph tests: 13/15 passed (2 failed due to missing test data)

### Commits Made
1. `66777b2` (main) - Phase 1 complete with 70 new tests
2. `5fc201b` (chore/doc-cleanup) - NATS config fix

## Key Decisions Made
- Used `nats://nats:4222` for Docker service name (not localhost)
- Made migration idempotent to handle cases where graph tables don't exist yet
- Phase 2 parallelization with agent-sandboxes was started but interrupted

## Current State
- All Phase 1 infrastructure working
- Branch `chore/doc-cleanup` has NATS fix (needs PR/merge to main)
- Phase 2 tasks identified but not started

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Merge NATS fix** - Create PR for `chore/doc-cleanup` → main
2. **Start Phase 2** using agent-sandboxes for parallel development:
   - Task 2.1: ComposedQuery Schema (`backend/app/schemas/query.py`)
   - Task 2.2: Intent Parser Service (`backend/app/services/intent_parser.py`)
3. Continue with Phase 2 tasks per execution plan

## Open Questions/Blockers
- None - ready to proceed with Phase 2
