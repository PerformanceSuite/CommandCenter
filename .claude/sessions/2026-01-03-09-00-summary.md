# Session Summary: AutoCoder Skills Refactor Code Review

**Date:** 2026-01-03
**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Branch:** `review/auto-coder-skills-refactor-ec72af0`

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Multi-agent code review** of commit `ec72af0` (AutoCoder composable skills architecture)
2. **Launched 6 parallel review agents:**
   - kieran-python-reviewer
   - pattern-recognition-specialist
   - architecture-strategist
   - security-sentinel
   - code-simplicity-reviewer
   - agent-native-reviewer
3. **Synthesized findings** into 8 structured todo files in `todos/` directory
4. **Created PR #135** with review findings

## Key Findings

### P1 Critical (5)
- Path traversal via unvalidated `project_dir` (security)
- Unsafe sys.path manipulation in bridges (security)
- SandboxBridge stubs return None instead of NotImplementedError
- Parameter `input` shadows Python built-in
- Silent ImportError swallowing

### P2 Important (2)
- MCP provider missing output_schema
- Exception handling too broad

### P3 Nice-to-have (1)
- Remove unused SkillMetadata fields (~30 LOC reduction)

## Key Decisions Made

1. Used compound-engineering:workflows:review skill for structured review
2. Created todo files following file-todos skill pattern
3. Documented all findings with proposed solutions and acceptance criteria
4. Created separate review branch and PR rather than modifying code directly

## Current State

- **Main branch:** Contains commit `ec72af0` (skills refactor)
- **Review branch:** `review/auto-coder-skills-refactor-ec72af0` with 8 todo files
- **PR:** #135 open for review at https://github.com/PerformanceSuite/CommandCenter/pull/135

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Address P1 findings (security critical):
   - Add path validation to project_dir fields
   - Fix sys.path manipulation
   - Replace SandboxBridge stubs with NotImplementedError
   - Rename `input` parameter to `skill_input`
   - Log ImportError instead of swallowing

2. Address P2 findings:
   - Add output_schema to MCP provider
   - Improve exception handling

3. Consider P3 simplifications:
   - Remove unused metadata fields

## Open Questions

- Should SandboxBridge be deleted entirely (YAGNI) or kept with NotImplementedError?
- What should the allowed base directory be for project_dir validation?
- Should MCP provider have authorization/rate limiting?

## Resume Context

Code review of the AutoCoder skills refactor is complete. The review identified 8 findings across security, code quality, and agent-native design concerns. All findings are documented in todo files with proposed solutions. The next logical step is to create a new branch and implement fixes for the P1 findings, starting with the security-critical path traversal vulnerability.
