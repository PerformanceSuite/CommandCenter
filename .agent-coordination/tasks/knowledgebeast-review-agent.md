## System Overview

**KnowledgeBeast Location:** `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/KnowledgeBeast`

**Core Technology Stack:**
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI (REST API)
- ChromaDB (vector database)
- Docling 2.5.5+ (document processing)
- sentence-transformers (embeddings)
- Click (CLI)
- Rich (terminal UI)

**Key Dependencies:**
1. **Docling** - Document processing (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
2. **ChromaDB** - Vector storage and similarity search
3. **sentence-transformers** - Embedding generation (local models)
4. **FastAPI** - Web API framework
5. **Tenacity** - Retry logic for I/O operations
6. **slowapi** - Rate limiting

## Tasks Checklist

### Task 1: Review Core RAG Implementation (3 hours)
- [ ] Read `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/KnowledgeBeast/knowledgebeast/core.py`
- [ ] Analyze embedding generation pipeline
- [ ] Review ChromaDB integration and collection management
- [ ] Check query performance and caching implementation
- [ ] Verify thread safety (mentioned: "fully thread-safe operations")
- [ ] Analyze LRU cache implementation for query results
- [ ] Review background heartbeat system
- [ ] Document any performance bottlenecks

**Focus Areas:**
- Vector search accuracy
- Cache hit rates and effectiveness
- Thread-safe operations under load
- Collection isolation mechanisms
- Query performance (target: sub-second)

---

### Task 2: Review Docling Integration (2 hours)
- [ ] Read `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/KnowledgeBeast/knowledgebeast/ingestion.py`
- [ ] Verify supported document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- [ ] Check document chunking strategy
- [ ] Analyze metadata extraction
- [ ] Review error handling for malformed documents
- [ ] Test Unicode and special character handling
- [ ] Verify memory usage for large documents

**Critical Checks:**
- Docling version compatibility (>=2.5.5)
- Document parsing accuracy
- Chunking quality (semantic vs. fixed-size)
- Memory leaks on large file processing
- Error recovery mechanisms

---

### Task 3: Review API & Security (2 hours)
- [ ] Read `/Users/danielconnolly/Projects/KnowledgeBeast/knowledgebeast/api.py`
- [ ] Check FastAPI endpoint security
- [ ] Verify rate limiting implementation (slowapi)
- [ ] Review authentication/authorization
- [ ] Check CORS configuration
- [ ] Analyze input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Review error responses (no info leakage)
- [ ] Test API versioning strategy

**Security Concerns:**
- Injection attacks (query/path traversal)
- Rate limiting effectiveness
- Authentication mechanisms
- Data isolation between collections
- Error message information disclosure

---

### Task 4: Review Collection Isolation (2 hours)
- [ ] Read collection management code
- [ ] Verify per-project isolation via `collection_name` parameter
- [ ] Test cross-collection data leakage
- [ ] Check collection naming sanitization
- [ ] Review collection metadata storage
- [ ] Analyze collection creation/deletion lifecycle
- [ ] Verify no shared state between collections

**Isolation Tests:**
- Create 2 collections with different data
- Query collection A, ensure no results from collection B
- Test collection name collisions
- Verify metadata scoping

---

### Task 5: Review Performance & Concurrency (2 hours)
- [ ] Read concurrency implementation
- [ ] Analyze thread safety claims ("5-10x concurrent throughput")
- [ ] Review lock contention optimization
- [ ] Check connection pooling
- [ ] Analyze query batching
- [ ] Review embedding cache effectiveness
- [ ] Test concurrent write operations
- [ ] Benchmark query latency under load

**Performance Metrics:**
- Query latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Concurrent request handling
- Memory usage under load
- Cache hit rates
- Embedding generation speed

---

### Task 6: Review Error Handling & Reliability (1 hour)
- [ ] Read error handling patterns
- [ ] Check retry logic (tenacity integration)
- [ ] Verify graceful degradation
- [ ] Review logging completeness
- [ ] Analyze cleanup on failures
- [ ] Test recovery from ChromaDB crashes
- [ ] Verify no data corruption on failures

**Reliability Checks:**
- ChromaDB connection failures
- Document parsing errors
- Out-of-memory conditions
- Concurrent access conflicts
- Cleanup on unexpected shutdowns

---
