## Tasks Checklist

### Task 1: Review Current Architecture Compatibility (2 hours)
- [ ] Read existing backend architecture
- [ ] Check FastAPI compatibility with MCP servers
- [ ] Verify PostgreSQL schema supports multi-project
- [ ] Analyze Redis caching for per-project isolation
- [ ] Review current authentication system
- [ ] Check if services can be wrapped as MCP tools
- [ ] Verify async/await compatibility

**Compatibility Checks:**
- FastAPI + MCP server coexistence
- Database schema extensibility
- Service layer MCP adaptability
- Authentication integration
- API versioning strategy

---

### Task 2: Review Per-Project Isolation Readiness (2 hours)
- [ ] Analyze current data isolation (if any)
- [ ] Check database schema for project_id support
- [ ] Review ChromaDB collection strategy
- [ ] Verify Redis key namespacing
- [ ] Check file system isolation
- [ ] Analyze configuration management
- [ ] Review secret management per project

**Isolation Requirements:**
- Database: project_id foreign key everywhere
- ChromaDB: collection_name = project_{id}
- Redis: key prefix = project:{id}:*
- Files: .commandcenter/ per project root
- Secrets: encrypted per project

---

### Task 3: Review Integration Points (1 hour)
- [ ] Identify where MCP servers hook into CommandCenter
- [ ] Check backend service → MCP tool mapping
- [ ] Verify frontend → MCP resource compatibility
- [ ] Analyze RAG service → KnowledgeBeast MCP integration
- [ ] Review GitHub service → API Manager integration
- [ ] Check agent coordination → AgentFlow MCP integration

**Integration Points:**
1. Backend services → MCP tools
2. RAG service → KnowledgeBeast MCP
3. GitHub API → API Manager MCP
4. Agent system → AgentFlow MCP
5. UI analysis → VIZTRTR MCP (if applicable)

---

### Task 4: Review Configuration & .env Management (1 hour)
- [ ] Analyze current .env structure
- [ ] Check if supports per-project config
- [ ] Review secret management
- [ ] Verify environment variable isolation
- [ ] Check configuration validation
- [ ] Analyze .commandcenter/config.json compatibility

**Configuration Needs:**
- Per-project .env files
- Shared vs. project-specific secrets
- API key management
- Database connection per project
- MCP server configuration

---

### Task 5: Review Existing Issues from Previous Reviews (1 hour)
- [ ] Read SECURITY_REVIEW.md - check if issues fixed
- [ ] Read BACKEND_REVIEW.md - verify improvements
- [ ] Read RAG_REVIEW.md - check ChromaDB status
- [ ] Review any open issues from 8 merged PRs
- [ ] Verify all critical fixes were applied
- [ ] Check for regression risks

**Previous Issues:**
- Security vulnerabilities (from SECURITY_REVIEW.md)
- Architecture issues (from BACKEND_REVIEW.md)
- RAG problems (from RAG_REVIEW.md)
- Testing gaps (from TESTING_REVIEW.md)

---

### Task 6: Review Deployment & Docker Compatibility (1 hour)
- [ ] Check Docker Compose for multi-project support
- [ ] Verify container isolation
- [ ] Review volume mounting strategy
- [ ] Analyze port management for multiple instances
- [ ] Check Traefik reverse proxy compatibility
- [ ] Review CI/CD pipeline adaptability

**Docker Requirements:**
- Multiple CommandCenter instances possible
- Per-project volumes
- Network isolation
- Port conflict avoidance
- Traefik routing per project
