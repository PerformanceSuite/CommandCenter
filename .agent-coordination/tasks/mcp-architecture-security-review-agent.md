# MCP Architecture Security Review Agent - Task Definition

**Mission:** Security review of proposed MCP integration architecture
**Worktree:** worktrees/mcp-architecture-security-review-agent
**Branch:** review/mcp-architecture-security
**Estimated Time:** 10 hours
**Dependencies:** None (Phase 0 - Pre-MCP Review)

---

## System Overview

**MCP Architecture Plan:**
- 5 MCP servers: Project Manager, KnowledgeBeast, AgentFlow, VIZTRTR, API Keys
- Per-project isolation (.commandcenter/ folder)
- Cross-IDE support (stdio transport)
- Multi-provider AI routing
- Slash command integration

**Security Concerns:**
- MCP server trust model
- Stdio transport security
- Per-project data isolation
- API key management across providers
- Code execution via agents
- Browser automation (VIZTRTR/Puppeteer)

---

## Tasks Checklist

### Task 1: Review MCP Protocol Security (2 hours)
- [ ] Analyze stdio transport security model
- [ ] Check JSON-RPC 2.0 vulnerability surface
- [ ] Review MCP SDK security practices

- [ ] Check for injection attack vectors
- [ ] Analyze authentication mechanisms
- [ ] Review authorization model

**Security Checks:**
- Stdio transport isolation
- JSON-RPC injection prevention
- Tool execution sandboxing
- Resource access controls
- Authentication required?
- Authorization granularity

---

### Task 2: Review Per-Project Isolation Security (2 hours)
- [ ] Analyze .commandcenter/ folder security
- [ ] Check file permission enforcement
- [ ] Review project_id validation
- [ ] Verify no cross-project data leakage

---

### Task 3: Review API Key Management Security (2 hours)

- [ ] Check encryption at rest (already uses crypto.py)
- [ ] Verify key rotation mechanism
- [ ] Review key access logging
- [ ] Check for plaintext key exposure
- [ ] Analyze multi-provider key handling
- [ ] Verify no keys in logs or errors

**API Key Security:**
- Encryption algorithm (Fernet/AES)
- Key derivation (PBKDF2)
- Rotation without downtime
- Access audit trail
- No plaintext logging
- Secure transmission

---

### Task 4: Review Code Execution Security (2 hours)
- [ ] Analyze AgentFlow code execution
- [ ] Check VIZTRTR code application safety
- [ ] Review sandbox/isolation for agent code
- [ ] Verify no arbitrary command execution
- [ ] Check file write permissions
- [ ] Analyze code validation before execution
- [ ] Review rollback mechanisms

**Code Execution Risks:**
- Agent-generated code execution
- File modifications by agents
- Git operations by agents
- Shell command execution
- Docker container access
- Filesystem boundaries

---

### Task 5: Review Browser Automation Security (1 hour)
- [ ] Analyze Puppeteer security model
- [ ] Check headless browser sandboxing
- [ ] Review Chrome DevTools Protocol access
- [ ] Verify no arbitrary navigation
- [ ] Check screenshot data handling
- [ ] Analyze DOM manipulation safety
- [ ] Review cookie/session isolation

**Browser Security:**
- Puppeteer sandbox enabled
- No arbitrary URL navigation
- Cookie isolation per project
- Screenshot PII redaction
- DevTools access restricted
- Resource limits enforced

---

### Task 6: Review Trust Boundaries & Attack Surface (1 hour)
- [ ] Map all trust boundaries
- [ ] Identify attack surface per MCP server
- [ ] Analyze external dependencies
- [ ] Review third-party library security
- [ ] Check supply chain security
- [ ] Analyze network exposure
- [ ] Review error information disclosure

**Trust Boundaries:**
1. User → MCP servers
2. MCP servers → Backend services
3. MCP servers → External APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
4. MCP servers → File system
5. MCP servers → Database
6. MCP servers → Browser (Puppeteer)
