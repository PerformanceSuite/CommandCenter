1. monitor-phase1a.sh - Recursive monitoring (5 min intervals)
2. validation-dashboard.sh - Real-time status dashboard
3. check-agents.sh - Quick agent status check
4. watchdog.sh - Automated validation trigger
5. validate-phase1a.sh - 3-level validation
6. diagnose-ci-failures.sh - CI diagnostic tool

Next Actions:
1. Continue monitoring for Agent 1 and Agent 2 status files
2. Wait for agents to complete their work
3. Run Level 1 validation when all agents complete
4. Run Level 2 and Level 3 validations sequentially
5. Execute auto-merge when all pass
6. Generate final completion report

Ready State:
✅ Monitoring infrastructure complete
✅ Validation scripts ready
