# Session Summary: Skills API Testing & Validation

**Date**: 2026-01-02 05:35 UTC
**Branch**: main

## Accomplished

1. **Backend Restart & Skills API Validation**
   - Restarted backend with `uvicorn` (NATS disabled, Redis disabled)
   - Verified all 6 Skills API routes are loaded and accessible

2. **Manual API Testing**
   - Tested `/api/v1/skills` (list) - works with auth + project
   - Tested `/api/v1/skills` (create) - successfully created skill
   - Tested `/api/v1/skills/import` - imported 6 skills from `~/.claude/skills`
   - Tested `/api/v1/skills/search` - verified query, category, and combined filters

3. **Test Suite Fixes**
   - Fixed `test_skills.py` to use `authenticated_client` fixture instead of non-existent `authenticated_headers`
   - Updated `conftest.py` `authenticated_client` fixture to create project and assign user
   - All 11 skills API tests now pass

4. **Commits Pushed**
   - `29f83e0` - fix(tests): update skills tests to use authenticated_client fixture

## Key Decisions

- Skills API requires project context (user must have project assigned)
- Used `authenticated_client` fixture pattern which includes auth headers
- Import endpoint reads YAML frontmatter from skill markdown files

## Current State

- Backend running on `http://localhost:8000` (background process)
- Skills API fully functional with 7 skills in database (1 test + 6 imported)
- All tests passing

## Next Steps

- Consider adding import tests to `test_skills.py`
- May want to add multi-word search support (currently returns 0 for "context token")
- Could add skill validation endpoint testing

## Open Questions

- Should skill search support OR/AND logic for multi-word queries?
- Should import have overwrite confirmation in tests?

## Files Modified

- `tests/conftest.py` - Updated authenticated_client fixture
- `tests/test_skills.py` - Fixed fixture usage
