## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Before Launching Agents

1. **GitHub CLI Required**
   ```bash
   brew install gh
   gh auth login
   ```

2. **Create Remaining Task Files**
   - Only `security-agent.md` created as example
   - Need to create 7 more: backend, frontend, rag, devops, testing, docs, github
   - Use `security-agent.md` as template

3. **Docker Should Be Running**
   - For running tests
   - For development environment

4. **Review Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cat .agent-coordination/dependencies.json
   ```

### During Execution

1. **Monitor Regularly**
   - Watch for failed agents
   - Check review scores
   - Verify test results

2. **Handle Conflicts**
   - Agents report conflicts in status
   - Manually resolve in worktrees
   - Update status after resolution

3. **Check Logs**
   - Each agent logs to `.agent-coordination/logs/`
   - Useful for debugging failures
